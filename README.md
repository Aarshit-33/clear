# clear
CLEAR is a private, opinionated system for mental offloading and daily decision-making. It lets you dump everything out of your head, processes it quietly, and decides what actually matters today — reducing noise, indecision, and cognitive load. Built for personal use. No gamification. No productivity theater.
